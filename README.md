# Typescript Learning

In order to create a solid understanding of the Angular Frontend framework; one must first have a solid grasp of the TypeScript fundamentals.

This repo records and tracks the programming problems that I will be solving using TypeScript in the month of April.
All functions serve purposes, and are ones that I think of right off the bat; some are leetcode-style problems, while others are simpler.

Goal: gain a deep understanding of TypeScript before moving on to Angular. 




# That's It!
